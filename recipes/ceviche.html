    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This sea bass ceviche is a juicy freshness overload and truly the best ceviche I've ever had. The flavors are bright, slightly salty, with a kick of heat and a bit of sweetness. Cold and crunchy with tender fish and creamy avocado, the textures are very well balanced. The mango adds a delightful sweet burst.</p>
    <p>You can eat it as an entree or snack in any occasion, by yourself or with company.</p>
